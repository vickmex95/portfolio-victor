                                a system that can communicate with the access control through a relay, 
                                and in this way being able to grant access remotely, embedded system using a breadboard, arduino UNO, an Esp32 microcontroller and a servomotor and 
                                for user interactions a mobile app was built with simple buttons to open the door and generate codes</span>
